# Othello

Description:
This program simulates the classic board game Othello.  In which two players take turns placing pieces on the board so that every play contains an opponents piece between at minimum two of your pieces.  Once all of the pieces are played, the player with the most pieces controlled on the board, wins.  In this program, the user controls one color and an AI controlled player controls the other color. At the moment, the user is black and the AI is white.
